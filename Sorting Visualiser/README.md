# Sorting Visualiser
 
 ### This is a simple Sorting algorithms visualisation project made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
 
 This is my take on the sorting visualisation project. Like many others, I was inspired by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) to make this project.
 
The sorting algorithms implemented include 
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
